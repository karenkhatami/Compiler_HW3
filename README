Please find the file "sample-tet", including all the error types
mentioned in the assignment.

Our application considers declarations based on the nesting level. When
the nesting level decreases, it removes all the variables from the symbol
table. This way, we make sure at each line, we are looking at the most
nested available instance of a variable.

Our parser successfully finds all the errors in the Tests and our file.

Limits: 
The only case that it cannot handle is nested structure in Test2.
